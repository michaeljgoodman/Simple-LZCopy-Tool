# LZCopy commandline tool
## Usage
`.\LZCopy.exe compressed_file uncompressed_file`

## Disclaimer
I basically made this to decompress a single file and understand the LZ Expand API. It sees no evil, hears no evil, speaks no evil. Use with care as I literally catch no errors.

If you do wish to modify, the decompress function does return some errors values that you can use to make a bit more of a refined tool.
